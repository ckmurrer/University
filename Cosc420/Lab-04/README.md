1) The non file version of the eigenvector functions time complexity is O(2n^3)+(n/p)^2+2(n/p) the normalization is only O(n/p) and if the function is ran a large number of times thats where the (2n^3+(n/p)^2) comes from. For the file version of the function is is O((n/p)^3+2pn+4*(n/p)). This comes from the multiplication function being used within the method as well as how it is computing the normalization of the matrices that are getting used.

2) If there was enough nodes to evenly distrubute the data amongst themselves then there is a possiblity of there being an equal amount of opperations per node. However that is only a slime chance of happening with large datasets.

3) Some real world uses or this program would consist of those who are trying to find the eigenvectors of large amounts of data in order to solve a problem

4) At the time of submission the code only produced seg faults so I dont even know how and where i would begin in order to produce a more updated and improved program.
